## Drone As Emergency Vehicle 
 
 * The purpose of the tello drone in this project is to help in pandamic(covid -19) as an emergency vehicle. 
 * Imagine the drone is picking up the masks, vaccines, people from one location to the hospital and from hospital to the source location
 * We have tried many things on tello drone as follows:  
     * **Key Press**: by pressing the key on keybord(example f - forword, b-backword and so on) the drone will follow the instructions.
     * We have done that using easytello library from Tello which has inbult commands for tello drone and keyboard libraray for keypress.
     * By using the tello commands we created the autonoums paths for drone in order to have city tour.
     * **Ploygon path**: Implemeted the code which takes input any sides of polygon and asks the drone to follow that path.
     * **Face Tracking**: The drone tracks the face and follow the direction of face as it moves
     * **Path Planning using grid**: Also, we tried to make the grid of enviornment and perform the semi autonimous path planning using the pygame libarary
     * **Dynamic path planning using ArUco markers**: Implemented the dyanmaic path planning by dtecting the ArUco markers at source and destination positiona and calculate the distance between them and follow the path.
