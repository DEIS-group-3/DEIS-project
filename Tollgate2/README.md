## Tollgate 2 - Research step
We need to present individual research step based on Decision & Control topic. 
We have discussed among our group members and decided to work on specific research area in automotive robot. Some of us demonstrated the working prototype of the robot. 

You can see the demos in the presentation file. 

For instance, 
you can see the collision avoidance using ultrasonic sensor in [![this](https://img.youtube.com/ciCuw-6MPdI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ciCuw-6MPdI "collision avoidance") video;
you can see the automatic cruise control based on ultrasonic sensor in [![this](https://img.youtube.com/x-I3NpXtYt8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/x-I3NpXtYt8 "ACC") video;
you can see the speed variation of the robot according to its orientation in [![this](https://img.youtube.com/x-I3NpXtYt8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/x-I3NpXtYt8 "ACC") video. <!--- NEED TO UPDATE LINK--->;
you can see the speed control on downhill in [![this](https://img.youtube.com/x-I3NpXtYt8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/x-I3NpXtYt8 "Speed control on Downhill") video. <!--- NEED TO UPDATE LINK--->;
you can see the speed control on uphill in [![this](https://img.youtube.com/x-I3NpXtYt8/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/x-I3NpXtYt8 "Speed control on Uphill") video. <!--- NEED TO UPDATE LINK--->.
